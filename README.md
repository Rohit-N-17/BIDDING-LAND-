# BIDDING-LAND-
The Bidding Land Using Machine Learning project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts land prices and optimal bid values by analyzing multiple influencing factors. Traditional land bidding often relies on manual estimation, market intuition, and negotiations, which can lead to underbidding or overbidding.
